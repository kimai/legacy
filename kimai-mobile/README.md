Kimai - jQuery Mobile Interface
===============================

This repository contains an mobile optimized interface of Kimai. 
Its a small website that lets you start and stop your time record from 
mobile devices.

It is built with jQuery Mobile support and works as a developer demonstration
for the Kimai Remote API. For now its has the following features:

* log in
* read projects
* read customers
* read tasks
* start the timer
* stop the timer

Its a very lightweight solution made with only one HTML script, a couple of 
Javascript files and some spicy CSS sugar on top.

Please note, that this is the first (experimental) release and many features of the 
complete version are missing. We don't have plans to add more features soon, but we'd like to hear 
your about thoughts and feature requests at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/kimai/kimai-mobile/issues).
