# Extensions

For example the timesheet, export and expenses screen (which you get by clicking the corresponding tab) is called an extension. To disable an Extensions just add a hash (#) symbol in front of the folder name. To re-enable it, remove the hash.

For developing an extension please refer to the [Kimai forum](http://forum.kimai.org).
